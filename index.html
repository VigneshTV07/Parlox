        <h1>PARALOX WEBSITE</h1>
        <div class="i1">
            <p class="c1">Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content is moved at a different speed than the foreground content while scrolling.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="i2">
            <p class="c2">Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="i3">
           <p class="c3"> The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. Its first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as early as Disneyâ€™s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and in video games such as Super Mario. </p>
